This enhances visual understanding and makes the diagram more engaging.  \n4. **Connection and Security Elements:**\n- Vertical dashed lines represent firewalls, labeled as **Internal firewall** (between Headquarters and DMZ) and **External firewall** (between DMZ and Internet). These indicate points of security enforcement to protect networks from unauthorized access.\n- Solid blue lines are present between sections, likely representing data flow or connectivity channels, reinforcing the idea of communication pathways between the segments.",
